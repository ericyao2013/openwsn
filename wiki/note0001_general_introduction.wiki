Q: introduction of the "note"
R:
when i have some ideas, i write them down as "note". you can try to catch the idea of openwsn through these "notes". 

the notes can be divided into three categeories:

- developing note: for the developer of openwsn system
- application note: for the user of openwsn system
- specification

most of "note" are draft only. this means they are only some proposal. some "note" will upgrade to "specification" after developing and testing and discussions. then all the members in openwsn community should follow the "specification".

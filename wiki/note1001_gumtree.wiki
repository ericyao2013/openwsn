Q: what's GumTree?
R: 
gumtree is an excellent open source software based on Eclipse. it can take LabView/Matlab instead as a frontier of measuring systems. 


Q: can openwsn project integrate gumtree project as its default data analyzer? (gumtree is a powerful opensource data analyzer)
R: 
yes, i think openwsn can do this. but we need to develope a driver for openwsn so the higher level gumtree can read/write data from/to the network through the driver. 

i will be very glad if some voluteers can do this for openwsn community.

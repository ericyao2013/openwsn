OpenWSN means Open Wireless Sensor Networks. It's a fundamental platform for WSN research and applications. It was initiated by TongJi University firstly and now we have members from Bradford, SJTU, Beihang, NWPU, etc. The current version of OpenWSN hardware is based on LPC213x/LPC214x ARM7 + TI/Chipcon cc2420.

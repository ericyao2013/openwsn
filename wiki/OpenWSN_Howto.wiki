= Q: How to work with googlecode's git = 
R: 

Software Install:

1 msysgit. Please install it to d:\bin\msysgit
2 TortoiseGit. Please install it to d:\bin\TortoiseGit


Now we will prepare local working directory

1 Create folder: 

create d:\dev\openwsn\source\node

2 Git create responsitory here

Now there should be an hidden .git folder in node directory. 

3
In TortoiseGit, verify and complete the following settings

TortoiseGit => Settings => Network: 
SSH Client = C:\Bin\TortoiseGit\bin\TortoisePLink.exe

TortoiseGit => Settings => Git Configure
Name: you can freely input your name or something. This name has no relationship with your true login ID or user name.
Email: ...

TortoiseGit => Settings => Git Remote
Remote = node
URL = https://code.google.com/p/tongji2011/node
Putty = D:\dev\openwsn\doc\git\openwsn_private_key_github.ppk

Since git uses HTTPS to communicate with googlecode, it requires you generate an SSH key. You can use PuttyGen in msysgit or 

TortoiseGit\bin to generate this ppk file. Remember to save the public key too for possible future use. 

4
now you can do source code synchronization with git on googlecode. 

The site administrator has already create a responsitory named node at tongji2011.googlecode.com. You can directly pull it or 

clone it using TortoiseGit. The local directory to accepting the source code should be d:\dev\openwsn\source\node\

You most often three operations are: Commit, Sync (Push first, then Pull)

Commit: work dir changes => local responsitory
Push: local responsitory => remote responsitory
Pull: remote responsitory => local responsitory



Attention
============================================================================
You should tell your google account to the administrator and let him to add you into the member list. Or else you may be 

rejected when pushing source code to the website.


push代码也许需要获取你在googlecode上由googlecode为你分配的pwd
但该pwd很可能需要能访问国外网站
